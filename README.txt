This repository contains my solutions to the problems in the book 
"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building A Modern Computer from First Principles"
by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.  As such, this will not be of interest to anyone except those
that are also reading this book and want to check their answers.
